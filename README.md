# Find Wally

Made in response of an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app) for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Check out the [Live App](https://totocorvidoni.github.io/todo-vue/)

Your task is to find Wally and the rest of the characters on this huge scene.
Once you have found a character simply click on them and confirm their face on the wheel that pops up. If you find all of them you will be able to submit your time so everybody can see how fast you were.

If you have no idea who this Wally guy is, [Wikipedia can tell you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F).

### Features

- Scrollable scene.
- UI that updates when you find a character.
- Highs Scores that persist on the server so you can show everybody how fast you were.

### Spoilers

Since it is a really hard puzzle (I actually had to google where Woof was) I marked their locations [here](/spoilers.jpg).
